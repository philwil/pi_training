Here are some basic instructions for using git in this training session.

First you get the git repo from github

   git clone git@github.com:philwil/pi_training.git

Thie will create a durectory called pi_training and place the git repository there.

   cd into the pi_training directory and you will be on the master branch.

This is the place where the class sources are kept.

Use git status to see what's happening.

  git status

  On branch master
  Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

  Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

 	git/

  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
 

You can see that we are on the master branch but we have a new , untracked dir called git which also holds this file "git_basics".

I am workng on this file and I am not yet ready to have it added to the master branch.
