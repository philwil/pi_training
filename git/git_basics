Here are some basic instructions for using git in this training session.

First you get the git repo from github

   git clone git@github.com:philwil/pi_training.git

Thie will create a durectory called pi_training and place the git repository there.

   cd into the pi_training directory and you will be on the master branch.

This is the place where the class sources are kept.

Use git status to see what's happening.

  git status

  On branch master
  Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

  Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

 	git/

  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
 

You can see that we are on the master branch but we have a new , untracked dir called git which also holds this file "git_basics".

I am workng on this file and I am not yet ready to have it added to the master branch.

So I will create a branch or copy of the master repo.

   git checkout -b phil

Lets add this file to phil's branch, infact we add the whole directory.

  git add git

Any time we add stuff we have to commit.



   git commit -m " added git stuff"
     [phil 563a6b8]  added git stuff
     2 files changed, 34 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 git/#git_basics#
     create mode 120000 git/.#git_basics

And check again using git status

  git status
  On branch phil
  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   git/#git_basics#

  Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	git/git_basics

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


Hmm not quite what we want , Lets remove the unwanted files #git_basics# and .#git_basics# and add in the file we want

git
