Files are one of the key components in a unix system

Not only can you use them to store programs and data but they are also one of the components used to control system interfaces.

There are two basic methods to access a file. Or rather associate a file name with one of two sorts of handles.


The basic file handler uses open/close/read/write/ioctl and mmap commands to handle data

file_101.c deals with those interfaces

The stream file ahndler is very convenient for handling file data as a stream object
Here we use the fopen/fclose commands together woth the fread, fwrite, fgets, fprintf etc commands

Look in file_201.c for that stuff.
