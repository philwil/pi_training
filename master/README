This is the master directory of the pi training material.


Each user will create their own clone of this master directory.
We'll work out exactly how in a few days.


Some simple git commands

git clone git@github.com:philwil/pi_training.git

This will get the initial repository

git checkout -b phil

This will create your own branch of the master called phil


Edit / add files as needed

Use 
  git add code/hello/hello.c
  git add code/hello/Makefile

To add a simple example

  git commit -m " Added some simple code"

Revert back to master

  git checkout master


Merge in the phil Branch

  git merge phil

Check the status
  git status

Push the combined master back to github

  git push
