This is the master directory of the pi training material.


Each user will create their own clone of this master directory.
We'll work out exactly how in a few days.


Some simple git commands

git clone git@github.com:philwil/pi_training.git

This will get the initial repository

git checkout -b phil

This will create your own branch of the master
